Portable Computing Language (PoCL) v3.1 released
------------------------------------------------

PoCL is a portable open source (MIT-licensed) implementation of the
OpenCL standard. It likely supports the minimal v3.0 feature set (official
conformance stamp not yet applied for).

In addition to being an easily portable multi-device (truly
heterogeneous) open-source OpenCL implementation, a major goal of this
project is improving interoperability for diversity of OpenCL-capable
devices by integrating them to a single centrally orchestrated platform.
Another key goal is to enhance performance portability of OpenCL
programs across device types utilizing runtime and compiler techniques.

Upstream PoCL currently supports various CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs via libcuda,
Vulkan-compatible GPUs (experimental) and ASIPs (experimental,
see: http://openasip.org). It is also known to have multiple (private)
adaptations in active production use.

Release Highlights
------------------

* Support for Clang/LLVM 15.0.
* Major rework of the custom device driver (formerly named Accel, now AlmaIF)
  with support for more device types implementing AlmaIF
* All device names used to control the platform setup via POCL_DEVICES are now
  lowercase (as documented in the user manual)
* Major rework of the custom device driver (formerly named Accel, now AlmaIF)
  with support for more device types implementing AlmaIF
* Much improved SPIR-V support for CPU and CUDA drivers
* Various improvements to & more steps towards implementing the complete API in
  the WIP Vulkan driver
* Basic implementation of cl_khr_command_buffer

Misc. Notes
-----------

* Please note that there's an official PoCL "maintenance policy" in
place. This text describes the policy and how you can get your favourite
project that uses OpenCL to remain regression free in the future PoCL
releases: http://portablecl.org/docs/html/maintainer-policy.html

* We are still looking for ARM CPU and RISC-V CPU maintainers (and
any other target of your interest). If you are interested in ensuring
PoCL stays stable for these processor architectures in the future,
please contact us.

* The dedicated TTASim driver will be deprecated once the AlmaIF driver
reaches feature parity with it.
